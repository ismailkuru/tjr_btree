* Notes on testing

See src/j_test

Things we can test:

- blk_dev functionality

- marshalling f2p, p2f

- B-tree map functionality via store_to_map, with a simple in-mem
  store and no marshalling, but with lots of different constants (see
  test_exhaustive_in_mem.ml; this uses a "known-correct" tree store)

- instances of the whole stack eg blk_dev on file, with binprot
  marshalling, various blk sizes, for int -> int, or string -> string,
  or string -> int
