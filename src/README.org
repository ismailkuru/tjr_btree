* Example with int -> int map

./ii_example.native is a reasonable demonstration:

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ time ./ii_example.native 
Executing 10000 writes...
Writing...
Deleting...
Checking...
Full check...

real	0m1.120s
user	0m0.908s
sys	0m0.188s
#+END_SRC

* Example with string -> string map

Reading and writing 10k (short) strings:

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ time ./simple_example.native 
Executing 10000 writes...
Writing...
Deleting...
Checking...
Full check...

real	0m1.726s
user	0m1.252s
sys	0m0.452s
#+END_SRC
